    description_long: "Are you a woman interested in learning how to build web applications with the latest technologies? We have good news for you: we are hosting a one-day workshop for beginners!
    <br> <br /> We believe that the IT industry will greatly benefit from bringing more women into technology. We want to give you an opportunity to learn how to program and become a developer.
    <br> <br /> <b>During the workshop you will build and deploy your very first Angular Web Application!</b> Angular is an open-source platform for building web application, developed by Google and the community. It provides various tools to easily create a dynamic, interactive app that can run on desktop browsers, mobile and even robots.
    <br> <br /> <b>The workshop is free of charge.</b> <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8uOZbx4rahJxBtuK-pH6sYzFJQrjXe3xEkOHJaH6ECigacw/viewform'>Just fill out the application form.</a> Don't wait too long - you can apply for a pass only until the stated deadline.
    <br> <br /> For the workshop you'll need some basic knowledge in web development: HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript or any other programming language. If you're a total beginner, that's ok! We'll send you some resources to catch up, and give you special attention during the workshop.
