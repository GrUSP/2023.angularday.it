        talk_title: "Angular Signals: what's all the fuss about?"
        talk_description: "Angular signals are a new feature that has the potential to revolutionize reactive programming in Angular, but apart from the newness of this new approach, the extreme love of some or the intense rejection of others, what are they really useful for? 
        <br />Was it because the word 'reactive' was attractive in a new feature or because it was a much-needed introduction to the world of Angular?
<br />Moreover, I will try to answer the most polarizing question after 'Does pineapple go on pizza': will signals replace RxJs? <br />
In this talk, I will take you through the history of Angular's signals, from inception to creation to implementation, to understand what leads to their genesis. <br />
You will learn what signals are and how they work, and through real-world use cases, I will show you how you can use them, switching existing logic from observables to signals.
<br />I invite you to join me on this journey towards a new era of Angular to learn more about signals and how they can improve your Angular development experience."

        <br />Welcome to the future of Angular development!
<br />
In this talk, we will embark on a journey into the heart of the Angular Directive Composition API. Together, we will unlock its potential, demystify its core concepts, and explore practical strategies for harnessing its power."

In this talk i want to show you how it works and a bunch of examples and tip and tricks to allow you a better use of NGRX, especially for the effects (the nightmare of all developers that use NGRX!)"

        talk_description: "Angular’s Reactive Forms module gives us a lot of control and flexibility to easily build and define our forms. 
        <br /> While looking at async data and form lifecycle events as streams, we can leverage the power of RxJS to react to these events. 
        <br />Presenting a non-trivial custom form control, I will show how I use Observables when creating the form, reacting to value and state changes, and validating the input."
